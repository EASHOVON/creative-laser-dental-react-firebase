  "desc": "Melancytes are cells which reside in the deeper layer of the gum tissue. These cells produce melanin, which are pigments that cause light or dark brown spots in gums and oral mucosa. The most common cause is genetic factors or tobacco smoking, Smokerâ€™s melanosis. If the melanin pigmentation is found in a person smoking cigarettes, the most effective way to get rid of the pigmentation is to stop smoking. Most of the patients are free from the melanin pigmentation after 3 months."
